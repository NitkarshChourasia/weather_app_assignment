### Random API Switching

In the code, `random.choice([api_key1, api_key2])` is used to randomly select between two API keys (`api_key1` and `api_key2`). This ensures that each time a request is made, either one of the two keys is used for accessing the OpenWeather API. This randomization helps in distributing the load between the two API keys or handling API rate limits, making the system more robust and less likely to hit rate limits on a single key.

### Dynamic Secret Key Generation

The secret key for Flask sessions is dynamically generated using the `generate_secret_key()` function, which utilizes the `secrets.token_hex(2048)` method to generate a cryptographically secure, random 2048-byte hexadecimal string. This is done to provide strong security for the session. If the generated key is `None`, the application falls back to an environment variable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, or uses a default fallback value to ensure the application runs without errors.
