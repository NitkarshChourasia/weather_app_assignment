# Tried Ways

Tried reverse-proxy and tunneling to expose my local port to the Internet using holesail.
Even tried to host my server on Vercel, and use reverse proxy P2P on Vercel to connect to my local server. - Failed

A solution I found is localTunnel, which is a free service that exposes your local server to the Internet. - Success
